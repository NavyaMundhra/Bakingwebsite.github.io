<h3 style="color:#FEDAF7;font-family:papyrus;"> Ingredients and Quantities: </h3>
<ul style="color:#FEDAF7;font-family:papyrus;"> 
<li> 4 egg whites </li>
<li> 1 cup sugar </li>
<li> 1 pinch salt </li>
<li> 1 tsp vanilla </li>
<li> 1/4 tsp cream of tartar </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color:#FEDAF7;font-family:papyrus;"> Method: </h3>
<ol style="color:#FEDAF7;font-family:papyrus;">
<li> Set oven to 200F. Separate the egg whites one at a time into a small bowl then transfer each white to the bowl of your stand mixer. You really don’t want to get any broken yolks in your bowl so separating them individually contains the damage if anything happens. </li>

<li> Add the cream or tartar and salt to the bowl then begin mixing on low and gradually increase the speed to high. </li>

<li> Once the egg whites have frothed up you can begin SLOWLY sprinkling in the sugar. This step makes a big difference in your final meringues so remember to take your time and add the sugar in gradually. You can do is a teaspoon at a time or just sprinkle it in slow as slow can be. After the sugar has been added it’s time to beat in some vanilla. </li>

<li> Your meringue is done once it has a Thick marshmallowy texture and can hold a nice peak. I would caution agains letting it sit for too long as it will pose consistency and not pipe as nicely if left to it’s own devices for too long. If you are coloring the meringue I suggest you add a SMALL, tiny amount of coloring in with a toothpick or skewer then beat in with the the whisk attachment to distribute the color. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large star attachment or with the tip snipped off. </li>

<li> Add small dollops of meringue to the corners of your baking sheet and press the parchment paper down. The meringue acts like glue and gives you a nice stable base to pipe on.  Pipe your meringues allowing at least an inch of space between each for airflow. Squeeze the piping bag while it’s about 1/2 an inch from the paper, lift as you squeeze then stop squeezing but continue to lift the finish the meringue. </li>

<li> Place on the center rack to bake at 200 for about an hour then turn the oven off and keep closed for an additional 1-2 hours. The meringue cookies are done when they're are dried throughout. You'll be able to lift them off the baking sheet and they will feel very light and dry. </li>
