<ol style="color:#F5D8AC;font-family:papyrus;">
<li> Preheat the oven to 350F </li>
<li> In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. </li>
<li> In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and cream cheese until smooth. Add sugar and beat at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. </li>
<li> Add 3 eggs, one at a time, beating until each is fully incorporated before adding another one. After adding 3 eggs, add 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture. Continue adding the other 3 eggs, one at a time. Beat in the vanilla. </li>
<li> Add 1/3 of the flour mixture mixing at low speed until combined. </li>
<li> Add half of the milk and mix until combined. Repeat, alternating with the rest of the flour mixture and milk. </li>
<li> Butter and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan or spray with baking spray with flour. </li>
<li> Pour the cake batter into the pan and tap gently on the counter a few times to settle the batter. </li>
<li> Bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. </li>
<li> Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Invert onto a cooling rack and cool completely. </li>
